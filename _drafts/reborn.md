# Reborn

One year ago I have stopped publishing articles on my blog. Since then I’m thinking reborn it with a new design.

The keywords for this were "**simplicity**" and "**open source".  
After some works, here it is ! I hope you will enjoy it.

## Thanks to …

Here is a lists of tools, libraires, etc. I used to rebuild this site.

### Pattern Lab

[@brad_frost](https://twitter.com/brad_frost) and [@dmolsen](https://twitter.com/dmolsen)’s [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/) is a wonderful tools that helps you to build an atomic design system.

[A separate repo on Github](https://github.com/alienlebarge/alienlebarge-patternlab) hold « Pattern Lab » for this blog. This is were I build the styles and the modules. When these things are ready to ship, I transfer them in [the Jekyll repo](https://github.com/alienlebarge/alienlebarge.github.com).

### InuitCSS

Last year, I went to a workshop in Zürich with [@csswizardry](https://twitter.com/csswizardry). It was so instructive that I wanted to apply his technics.
The stylesheets are heavily inspired by [inuitcss](http://inuitcss.com/).

### Grunt

[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) runs everything in this project.  
It compile/merge/minify the stylesheets, build Pattern Lab, export style to Jekyll etc.

Since Grunt appears in my development, I can’t live without it.

### Jekyll

To be simple, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) publish your markdown files as a website. That’s quite straightforward but that’s it.  
The ability to put my hands in the `HTML` and styles easily is very important for me. With Jekyll, I can fix the frontend without pain.

## Next Steps

The code need some cleaning and improvements. I will do that the followings month.  
Improving the code is one of my main goal about this website.

I will try to publish more article about my interests in the futur.

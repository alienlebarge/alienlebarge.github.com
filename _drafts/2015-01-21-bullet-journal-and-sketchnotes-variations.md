# Bullet Journal and Sketchnotes variations

At work, once a week, we have a meet at work to summarize the work of the last five working days. It is sometimes hard for me to remember on which project, issue, repository branch I have worked.
Since more than a year, I write down everything I do. This logging technique works well for and I want to share it with you.

This technique consist of a mix of *bullet journal* and *sketchnoting*.

## Everyday tasks ➛ Bullet journal

During a normal day of work, I use the bullet journal to log things on witch I have work. It means every mornings, I take some minutes to write down the tasks I have to accomplish during the day. Each of these tasks are precedent bay a little square. When the task is done, I mark it so.

This technique is called the [bullet journal](http://bulletjournal.com). Here is a video how it works:

## Meetings and conferences ➛ Sketchnotes

At conference and meetings, I use [Mike Rohde’s sketchnote technique](http://rohdesign.com/book/) for sketchnoting. Since I rode his first book « The Sketchnote Handbook », I started sketch noting a meetings. It’s fun and more visual.
My skills are becoming better with the practice and I enjoy more en more doing that. And the more funny is that my colleague really like watching my meetings littles comics.

## Material

Here’s my setup to mix this two techniques in a way I’m confortable with.

### Notebook

The **[Freitage F27 Notebook](http://www.freitag.ch/Fundamentals/Notebooks-%26-Agendas/NOTEBOOK/pa/F27_00017)** is great notebook. The big advantage over the classic Moleskin is that it’s compatible with the [Atoma binding system](http://www.atoma.be/). It means you can: 
- Remove pages, put them back or change their order without damaging the pages or the notebook.
- Exchange pages between various notebooks.
- Print and copy on pages before returning them to the notebook.
- Buy refills and insert those in existing notebooks.
- You can do your own page if you want. You just need a [Atoma hole puncher](http://www.atoma.be/en/puncher.php). (Every [Freitag store](http://www.freitag.ch/store-locator) own a puncher you can use.)

And yeah, it’s a Freitag !

### Pen

I don’t use a specific pen. It has to write in black and the maximum size is 0.5mm.

## Bullet journal

### Index

- On the first page
- On a separate page because we archive the content of the notebook.

### Month overview

#### Calendar view

- Following left page
- First column: day number
- Second column: Two first letter of the day
- Trace a bar aside the the day where you don’t work

#### Todos

- Following right page

### Days

## Sketchnote

## Page number

Using Atoma binding system means you can remove pages and archive them. So we need a time proof numbering technique. I use the date because it will not repeat.

- `2014-01`: January calendar
- `2014-01`: January todos
- `2014-01-01`: Page were the first day is the 1st of January
- `2014-01-04`: Page were the first day is the 4th of January  or date of a sketch note

# Bullet Journal and Sketchnotes variations

At work, once a week, we have a meet at work to summarize the work of the last five working days. It is sometimes hard for me to remember on which project, issue, repository branch I have worked on.
Since more than a year, I write down everything I do. This logging technique works well for and I want to share it with you.

This technique consist of a mix of *bullet journal* and *sketchnoting*.

## Everyday tasks ➛ Bullet journal

During a normal day of work, I use the bullet journal to log things on witch I have work. It means every mornings, I take some minutes to write down the tasks I have to accomplish during the day. Each of these tasks are precedent by a little square. When the task is done, I mark it so.

This technique is called the [bullet journal](http://bulletjournal.com). Here is a video how it works:

## Meetings and conferences ➛ Sketchnotes

At conference and meetings, I use [Mike Rohde’s sketchnote technique](http://rohdesign.com/book/) for sketchnoting. Since I read his first book “The Sketchnote Handbook”, I started sketchnoting at meetings. It is fun and more visual. And as a visual personn, my brain better remember the information.

My skills are becoming better with the practice and I enjoy more en more doing that. And the more funny is that my colleagues really like watching my meetings little comics.

## Material

Here’s my setup to mix this two techniques in a way I'm comfortable with.

### Notebook

The [Freitage F27 Notebook](http://www.freitag.ch/Fundamentals/Notebooks-%26-Agendas/NOTEBOOK/pa/F27_00017) is great notebook. The big advantage over the classic Moleskin is that it’s compatible with the [Atoma binding system](http://www.atoma.be/). That means you can:
- Remove pages, put them back or change their order without damaging the pages.
- Switch pages between various notebooks.
- Scan pages before returning them to the notebook.
- Buy refills and insert those in existing notebooks.
- You can do your own page if you want. You just need a [Atoma hole puncher](http://www.atoma.be/en/puncher.php). (Every [Freitag store](http://www.freitag.ch/store-locator) own a puncher you can use.)

And yeah, it’s a Freitag !

### Pen

I don’t use a specific pen. It has to write in black and the maximum size is 0.5mm.

## The mix

Here is a exemple of a month in my journal

- Page 1 (left): Calendar view
- Page 2 (right): Tasks for the month
- Page 3 (left): Start with the first day of the month
    - Day 1
        - Tasks for day 1
    - Day 2
        - Tasks for day 2
    - ... until the end of the week (every week, I start a new page.)
- Page 4: If I have a meetings on day 1, I put in a blank page on wich I will sketch.  

Think of a normal bullet journal in which are inserted sketchnotes. It means, I do a normal bullet journal and when I’m at a meeting a put in a blank page on which I will sketch.

It is simple ! no ?

During two days, Lausanne will host a conference about UX. On 22 and 23 May, speakers like [Oliver Reichenstein](https://twitter.com/@reichenstein "Oliver Reichenstein's Twitter profil"), [Indi Young](https://twitter.com/@indiyoung "Indi Young's Twitter profil"â€Ž), etc. will share their knowledge with the folks.

All the informations are available [online](http://2014.uxlausanne.com/ "UX Lausanne"). Some tickets are still available.

Many thanks to [the guys and girls who makes this happen](http://2014.uxlausanne.com/about "UX Lausanne team").

Maps are cool and I love them. Since I'm rebuilding this blog, I wanted to add some of them in the design. As I love trekking, I was thinking it was a fine idea to add them on posts where I talk about trekking and things like that.
[Katy DeCorah](https://twitter.com/katydecorah) was already doing that on [her blog](http://katydecorah.com). [Her work](http://katydecorah.com/code/2014/07/26/static-mapbox-for-jekyll/) was a great inspiration.

I will show you how I build this for this blog based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

Mapbox provide an API to build [static maps](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/api/static/). This is what I use to add the maps as background image in the header. I use static maps because they are only used as design elements. They don't need to be zoomable, etc.

## Building a map

### The request

This is the request for a map:

```
http://api.tiles.mapbox.com/v4/{mapid}/{lon},{lat},{z}/{width}x{height}.{format}?access_token=<your access token>
```

### What do we need ?

Here are the things we need:
- `mapid`
- `lon`
- `lat`
- `width`
- `height`
- `format`
- `access_token`

#### Things that don't change

The `mapid` and the `access_token` will always be the same. So I put them in the `_config.yml` config file. If they change, I just need to update them in one file.

```
mapbox_token: ...
mapbox_mapid: ...
```

`height` and `width` are hardcoded in the request. It would be nice to put them too in the config file. But I'm looking to add some media queries. So at this time, I keep them here.

The `format` will be `.png` because PNG is cool. It is hardcoded too.

#### Specific value

The only value that will change from a post to an other are the coordinates where to center the map and the zoom factor.

We will add them in the Front Matter of the post like this:

```
coordinates: 6.407948,46.718826
zoom: 13
```

### Build the request

We have to build the request for the background image.

```
http://api.tiles.mapbox.com/v4/{{ site.mapbox_mapid }}/{% for coordinate in page.coordinates limit:1 %}{{ coordinate }}{% endfor %},{% if page.zoom %}{{ page.zoom }}{% else %}15{% endif %}/800x800.png?access_token={{ site.mapbox_token }})
```

As you can see, the `page.zoom` isn't required. If there is no `zoom`value in the Front Mater, it will be set to `15`.

### The result

And here is the result:

```
http://api.tiles.mapbox.com/v4/alienlebarge.io3heb5m/6.407948,46.718826,15/800x800.png?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiYWxpZW5sZWJhcmdlIiwiYSI6Ik1hN3ZxVjgifQ.S2hbxqNnn7kU7HRnd6jYVg
```

## We want markers !

Maps are cool but if we can add  marker, it's even cooler. And yeah (!), [we can do that with Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/api/static/#markers)

We have to add the markers in the request juste after the `mapid`.

```
http://api.tiles.mapbox.com/v4/{mapid}/{markers}/{lon},{lat},{z}/{width}x{height}.{format}?access_token=<your access token>
```

### Markers parameters

The [`{markers}`](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/api/static/#markers) have to be formatted like that:

```
{name}-{label}+{color}({lon},{lat})
```

As everything are is specific for each post/map, we will add this in the Front Matter of the post.

```
markers:
- coordinates: 6.407948,46.718826
  name: pin-m
  label: water
- coordinates: 6.400716,46.717375
  name: pin-m
  label: rail
- coordinates: 6.400437,46.716507
  label: parking
- coordinates: 6.395974,46.722333
```

### Build it

Here is the liquid template code for the markers:

```
{% raw %}
{% for marker in page.markers %}
  {% if marker.name %}
    {{ marker.name }}
  {% else %}
    pin-m
  {% endif %}
  {% if marker.label %}
    -{{ marker.label }}
  {% endif %}
  (
    {% for coordinate in marker.coordinates limit:1 %}
      {{ coordinate }}
    {% endfor %}
  )
  {% if forloop.last %}
  {% else %}
    ,
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{% endraw %}
```

As you can see, `name` and `label` are not required.

So now, let's put everything together.

```
http://api.tiles.mapbox.com/v4/{{ site.mapbox_mapid }}/{% for marker in page.markers %}{% if marker.name %}{{ marker.name }}{% else %}pin-m{% endif %}{% if marker.label %}-{{marker.label}}{% endif %}({% for coordinate in marker.coordinates limit:1 %}{{ coordinate }}{% endfor %}){% if forloop.last %}{% else %},{% endif %}{% endfor %}/{% for coordinate in page.coordinates limit:1 %}{{ coordinate }}{% endfor %},{% if page.zoom %}{{ page.zoom }}{% else %}15{% endif %}/800x800.png?access_token={{ site.mapbox_token }}
```

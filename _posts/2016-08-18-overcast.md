[Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) is my favourite podcast app. Thanks to [Marco Arment](https://marco.org/) for building such a great app.
I use the app everytime I commute by car.

The sad news is that Overcast has no OSX app.

As you can read Overcast provides a web app to listen to your podcast online. But there is two problems with the fact it live in your browser:

1. Sometime you close your browser and Overcast is gone.
2. There's no hotkeys to play/pause easily.

## 1. Turn Overcast webservice into an app

The first point is fixed by turning Overcast web service into an app with [Fluid](http://fluidapp.com/).

## 2. Create your own hotkeys

The second missing feature can be resolved by using [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com) to provide some hotkeys for Overcast.

Simply create a macro triggered by the hot key of your choice. That macros have to execute an AppleScript to simulate a click on the different buttons.

Here's the one to play/pause the podcast:

    tell application "Overcast"
        do JavaScript "document.getElementById('playpausebutton').click()"
    end tell

How to go back:

    tell application "Overcast"
        do JavaScript "document.getElementById('seekbackbutton').click()"
    end tell

And to go forward:

    tell application "Overcast"
        do JavaScript "document.getElementById('seekforwardbutton').click()"
    end tell

## Download it

I have set a litlle Github repository where [you can download those macros](https://github.com/alienlebarge/km-overcast). Feel free to contribute.

## Support Overcast

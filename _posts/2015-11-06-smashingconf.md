At a time when we start having to scrape his windshield in the morning, I had the chance to spend three days in Barcelona where  one of my main concerns in the morning was whether I was going to wear shorts or pants for the day.

The purpose of these three days in this beautiful city was to take part of the Smashing Conference and the associated workshop.

This conference was tremendous and I canâ€™t recommend hardly enough to participate to that kind of conference if you are in the web industry.

I'll try these next days to post notes of the differents presentations.

So, stay tuned.

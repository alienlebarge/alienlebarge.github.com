The new iPhone will be available in a few days and I can not choose between the big and the bigger model.

## My iPhone 4 is (almost) dead

For four years now, I use an iPhone 4. I have decided to buy a new one. Using my iPhone 4 is a pain. It's slow, it freeze, it reboot constantly, the battery is almost dead, if I use it outside at under 17 °C temperature it stops working, the home button has stopped working a few month ago, etc.

It's time to change !

## Two new precious

The new Apple iPhone will come in two size:
- *iPhone 6* with a 4,7 inches screen.
- *iPhone 6 plus* with a 5,5 inches screen.

These two devices will be available order here in Switzerland the 26th of September. Yes, it's in two days ! And I can't choose which one I will order.

So here's the pros for each models:

### iPhone 6

- It fit in my hand. I have relatively small hands. I worry of something I can not use with one hand.
- I come from an iPhone 4. Going for an *iPhone 6* is already a big step in term of screen size. Imagine going for a *Plus*...
- It fit in my jeans front pockets.
- Less expensive than the *Plus*.

### iPhone 6 Plus

- It's big !
-I have two hours of commute each days. I read a lot in the public transportation. The *iPhone 6 Plus* can replace my *Kindle*.
- I love [the landscape view on the *Plus*](https://www.apple.com/iphone-6/display/ "Landscape view on iPhone 6 Plus").
- Bigger battery more autonomy.
- [The camera is better](http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/9/6091081/iphone-6-6-plus-camera-announced "Differences between iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus cameras").

## Conclusion

For now, I am 30% for the *iPhone 6* and 70% for the *iPhone 6 Plus*.  
I will read more reviews and watch more videos and ... Let see in two days.

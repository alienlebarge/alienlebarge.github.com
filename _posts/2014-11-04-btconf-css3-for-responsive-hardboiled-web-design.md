[Andrew Clark](http://www.twitter.com/malarkey) is running [Stuff & Nonsense](http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk) an agency who likes apes. He demonstrated us how we can use new CSS3 techniques to build website. We talk a lot about flexbox, how does the alignment works and how we can implement them.

I definitely have to dive in this subject.

Here are my sketchnotes:

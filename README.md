=======================

Currently, this is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) test.
I'm looking to replace in [my current Wordpress install](http://www.alienlebarge.ch/) with Jekyll

# Deployment

I'm currently testing some deployment routing. Here is the current process. It will evolve.

1. `$ grunt`
1. `$jekyll serve`
1. `http://localhost:4000`

Currently, this is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) test.  
I'm looking to replace in [my current Wordpress install](http://www.alienlebarge.ch/) with Jekyll

# Deployment

I'm currently testing some deployment routing. Here is the current process. It will evolve.

## CSS

The CSS is generated from LESS file using [RECESS](https://github.com/twitter/recess).
Just type this comande in the terminal `$ RECESS ./less/main.less --compile true > ./css/main.css`

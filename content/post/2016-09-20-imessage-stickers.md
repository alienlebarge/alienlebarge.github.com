I think Apple had made a great move with [the new iMessage platform](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-10-the-macstories-review/13/#imessage-as-a-platform "iMessage as a Platform on MacStories") on iOS 10.

My discussion feeds have become very messy but very funny.

Here's a list of my favorite stickers app:

- [Sticker Pals](https://itunes.apple.com/ch/app/sticker-pals-animate-your/id1128233487?mt=8 "Sticker Pals in iTunes"): A whole stickers plateforme.
- [Swarm](https://www.swarmapp.com/ "Swarm website"): Use your Swarm stickers in iMessage.
- [Stickimal](https://itunes.apple.com/ch/app/stickimal-by-yatatoy/id1148932526?mt=8 "Stickimal on iTunes"): Turn things into cute animals.
- [Emoji Stickers](http://www.raulriera.com/emoji "Emoji Stickers website"): Combine Emoji to make new Emoji.
- [Anitate](https://itunes.apple.com/ch/app/anitate-86-animated-stickers/id1149241845?mt=8 "Anitate on iTunes"): 86 great animated stickers.

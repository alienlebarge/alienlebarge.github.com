Reducing the gap between the thing in your head and the thing you make was the main topic of Brendan Dawes presentation. If you have a collection of things you have done, you can more easily present them and use them in real projects. His advice was to experiment, test things, build your library of ... projects that you can reuse or tweak for building "real" things.

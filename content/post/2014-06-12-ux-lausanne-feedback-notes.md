The first edition of [UX Lausanne](http://2014.uxlausanne.com/) was a really great event. I really appreciate it. If there will be a 2015 edition, you can count me in.

Well done guys !

It's now time to share my notes.  
The two last weeks, I was in holidays. I have (almost) totally disconnected from the online world. This why I come a bit late with my feedback.

The next days, I will publish my notes I have taken during the event with some additional informations.  
In the meanwhile, you can check what happened during the conference by browsing the `#uxls` hashtag on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23uxls "#uxls tag on Twitter") and [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/uxls/ "pictures tagged with #uxls on Flickr").

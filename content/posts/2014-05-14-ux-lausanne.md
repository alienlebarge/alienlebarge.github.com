During two days, Lausanne will host a conference about UX. On 22 and 23 May, speakers like [Oliver Reichenstein](https://twitter.com/@reichenstein), [Indi Young](https://twitter.com/@indiyoungâ€Ž), etc. will share their knowledge with the folks.

All the informations are available [online](http://2014.uxlausanne.com/). Some tickets are still available.

Many thanks to [the guys and girls who makes this happen](http://2014.uxlausanne.com/about).

// # Separators
//
// Visual separation between two sections
//
//   1. Disable `<hr>`
//   2. Pseudo center the font `content`
//   3. Don't strike thtough the text
//   4. Make it works even with no centered content
//   5. Prevent the dots to overlap outside the parent element
//
// ```
// <h1 class="separators"><span>Heading in a span</span></h1>
// <h1 class="separators"><span>Centered heading in a span</span></h1>
// <p class="separators"><span>Paragraph in a span</span></h1>
// <h1 class="separators"><a hre="#">Link</a></h1>
